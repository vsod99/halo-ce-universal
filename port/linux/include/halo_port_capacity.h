/*
HALO_PORT_CAPACITY.H

Memory capacity of the native builds (Windows, Linux, Android), sized for the
session limits in halo_port_limits.h, which includes this file. The Xbox
sizes are given in parentheses below.

Every machine in a session must be built with the same values: the
distributed netcode names objects and players by their datum index, the
same on every machine (port/linux/game/network_objects.c tracks
MAXIMUM_TRACKED_OBJECTS = HALO_PORT_MAXIMUM_OBJECTS_PER_MAP objects, and a
client's own objects take the upper half of the object array).

/* ---------- game state

The Xbox game state is 0x345000 bytes at 0x80061000 and ends where the tag
cache begins (0x803A6000). Cache files are linked to that tag cache address,
so the game state cannot grow in place. The native builds put a 16 MB game
state above the tag cache (which ends at 0x819A6000), inside the Xbox memory
window (0x80000000-0xA0000000, Android's to 0x88000000:
port/linux/src/platform.h) and below everything the window hands out
top-down (texture and sound caches, Direct3D resources).

The CPU part holds about 17.2 MB of pools at the sizes below (the Xbox pools
fill 3,165,260 of its 0x305000 bytes); the GPU part holds only the decal
vertices, as on the Xbox. A change to a pool's size changes the game state's
layout: saved games of builds before it no longer load. */

#ifdef HALO_XBOX
/* The original Xbox port (port/xbox) gives the kernel's contiguous memory
to the caches, and the game state is virtual memory at its own fixed
address (port/xbox/src/nxdk_memory.c). Only the sizes need be the same on

It lies above the Custom Edition tag cache's window, 0x40440000-0x41B40000,
and the page tables' 4 MB steps around it (nxdk_memory.c). */

/* ---------- textures

The texture cache holds the textures being drawn in 16 KB pages, 22 MB of
them on the Xbox, which Xbox maps were made to fit. Halo Custom Edition maps
were made for Halo PC, which has no such bound: a texture that does not fit
is drawn as the default one ("YOU GOT STABBED" in debug.txt; Elite_Alpha_Siege
did at 22 MB), and a frame of bigass_v3 draws more than 64 MB (DamnationCE's
measurement). The desktop builds' cache is 256 MB, half their 512 MB memory
window (port/linux/src/platform.h), whose pages are backed as they are used.
Android's window is 128 MB, as the web build's, and its cache the Xbox's,
as is the original Xbox port's (128 MB in all). */

The sound cache holds the sounds being played in 4 KB pages, 4 MB of them on
the Xbox. Halo Custom Edition maps' sounds, converted when they load
(port/linux/game/custom_edition_sounds.c), and those of sound tags loaded
over a map's (loose_sounds.c), are longer than the Xbox maps' and fill it (a
campaign map's dialogue and music did, "SOUND CACHE BLOWN" in debug.txt).
The desktop builds' cache is 16 MB; Android's and the web build's windows and
the original Xbox port keep the Xbox's. */

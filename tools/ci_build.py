#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Builds one port in one configuration, as the GitHub workflow does
(.github/workflows/build.yml), and collects what it built into dist/:

    python tools/ci_build.py linux debug
    python tools/ci_build.py android release
    python tools/ci_build.py linux profile
    python tools/ci_build.py web release
    python tools/ci_build.py xbox debug

Builds are portable (any x86-64 processor), so they run on other
computers. Debug builds skip link-time and profile-guided optimisation,
which only make the build slower; release builds use both, as a local
release build does (profile-guided optimisation needs clang 22 or later,
and is skipped with an older one). A profile build is a debug build with
configure.py --profile, so that the profiling build is built too. CI_COMPILER_LAUNCHER (ccache, say) is
passed on as --compiler-launcher. A build of the main branch gets the run's
number (HALO_BUILD_NUMBER), which its release is named after and the
self-updater compares (and the web site's version.json names).

The web build (port/web/README.md) needs Emscripten (emcc on the PATH, as
emsdk_env.sh puts it); dist/halo-web-<config>/ is the whole site, which a
static host serves as it is: the workflow publishes the release build's to
GitHub Pages.
